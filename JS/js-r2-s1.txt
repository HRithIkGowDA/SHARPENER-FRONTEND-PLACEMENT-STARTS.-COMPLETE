2) The main difference between the two is the order in which they are executed. process.nextTick is executed before any other I/O events, while setImmediate is executed after I/O events have been processed. This means that process.nextTick is generally used for non-blocking operations that need to be executed as soon as possible, while setImmediate is used for operations that can be delayed slightly.

 Promises have a built-in way to handle errors, whereas in callbacks, errors are usually passed as the first argument to the callback function.
Promises can be chained together, allowing for more complex and readable asynchronous code, while callbacks often lead to the "callback hell" problem.
Promises are more composable and reusable than callbacks
